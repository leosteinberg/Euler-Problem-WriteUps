My solutions to the Euler Problems. A place with my code (in C), an explanation of how it works/ my thought process and any resources I used to help me get there.

problems can be found at:

I am doing the first 250 on hackerank as I find it convenient and the problems are adapted for coding.

I am using the text editors Atom (for code) and TexStudio (for doccumentation)
